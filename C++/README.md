This module is an adaptation of RRT/RRT* using KDTrees.
This is C++ implementation of following type:

1) RRT\* with Simple RRT(Highly goal biased).<br />
2) RRT\* with archived RRT(Highly goal biased).<br />
3) RRT\* with RRT\*.<br />
4) RRT\* with goal Rooted RRT\*. <br />

The name of main algorithm is the result of process. Looking for a new name.
For any queries regarding the implementation or discussion on different things like complexity and scalability feel free to contact at iiita.coder@gmail.com
