This module is an adaptation of RRT/RRT* using KDTrees.
This is C++ implementation of following type:

1) RRT\* with Simple RRT(Highly goal biased).<br />
2) RRT\* with archived RRT(Highly goal biased).<br />
3) RRT\* with RRT\*.<br />
4) RRT\* with goal Rooted RRT\*. <br />

Description is not enough to understand whole process. Will modify it once paper will be published. :)
